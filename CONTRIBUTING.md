## Code Style Guidelines

- **HTML**: Follow semantic HTML practices. Keep the structure clear and easy to read.
- **CSS**: Use standard naming conventions (e.g., BEM). Avoid overly complex styles and keep them modular.
- **JavaScript**: Write clean and concise code. Use `let` and `const` instead of `var`. Make sure to comment your code where necessary.

## Branching Strategy
- All new features should be added in a separate branch from `main`.
- Make sure to keep your branch up to date by periodically pulling from the `main` branch.
